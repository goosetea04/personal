    title: "Monocular Depth Estimation",
    shortDescription: "Predicting depth from a single image using self-supervised deep learning techniques.",
    longDescription: "This project explores self-supervised monocular depth estimation using deep learning, aiming to predict scene depth from a single RGB image without requiring ground-truth depth maps. Leveraging modern convolutional architectures and internal consistency losses, the model learns spatial relationships within images, offering insights into 3D perception from 2D inputs. Built using PyTorch and OpenCV, this research-focused project demonstrates how internal image cues alone can inform depth prediction.",

    shortDescription: "End-to-end RAG-powered chatbot for corporate governance built with React, Node.js, and vector search.",
    longDescription: "RAG Bot is an interactive chatbot application built with Streamlit and powered by OpenAI's API, designed to showcase Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. It combines the strengths of large language models with custom document retrieval to deliver accurate, context-aware answers grounded in external data sources. Users can upload PDFs or connect knowledge bases, and the bot intelligently fetches relevant information to enhance its responses, reducing hallucinations. With a clean and responsive Streamlit interface, RAG Bot makes it easy to visualize retrieved documents alongside model-generated outputs, offering an intuitive and powerful tool for research, customer support, or internal knowledge queries.",
